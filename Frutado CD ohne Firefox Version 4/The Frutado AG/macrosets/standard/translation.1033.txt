g_highlight_fillstyle.h	This parameter works similar to the parameter Highlight Style, but fills the inside area of the highlighted area with the defined color or image. In this case transparency is also an option if you decide to use an image.
g_linktextpraxis.h	When there is a lesson pause during playback and the lesson can only continue when the user clicks on the link at the bottom of the text bubble being displayed, the text you enter here will be the link text.

If you would like to use your own images, please file them in the 'Resource' folder.
g_close_link.h	Clicking on the link in the displayed bubble can close a lesson in Concurrent Mode. The text you have entered here is used for the link. The text may contain HTML attributes. Therefore, it is also possible to include an image file path.\nAn image is used as default. If you would like to use your own image, please observe the following syntax:\n'<img src='${resource_dir}/next_red.gif' border=0 >'\nNote: The string '${resource_dir}' serves as a free variable parameter and is replaced by the datango producer later with the correct path to the 'Resource' folder in your workarea. It must always be contained in the path. If this placeholder is not used, then the playback of the lessons may be faulty. If you would like to use your own images, please file them in the 'Resource' folder.
