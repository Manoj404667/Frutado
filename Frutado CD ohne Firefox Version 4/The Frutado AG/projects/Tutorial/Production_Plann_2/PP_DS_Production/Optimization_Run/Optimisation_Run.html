<h1>'Optimization Run'</h1>
<div>

<P><FONT face=Verdana size=5><STRONG>Execute the PP/DS Optimization</STRONG></FONT> <FONT face=arial size=3>
<P>You implement optimization in PP/DS <STRONG>after a heuristic run</STRONG> has been executed to improve the solution.&nbsp; </P>
<P><FONT face=arial size=3>You can use optimization to&nbsp;improve the production dates and the resource allocation for operations in regard to one ore more of the following criterias.&nbsp;The objective&nbsp;function is defined in the optimization profile:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Makespan</STRONG></LI>In SAP APO this is defined as the time span between the earliest possible start time of a production plan specified by the user and the end of the last&nbsp; operation in the optimized plan.<BR><BR>
<LI><STRONG>Total Setup Times and Total Setup costs</STRONG></LI>You can use these criteria to take setup times and costs into account. The system determines setup times and setup costs that are dependent on sequence from the setup matrix.<BR><BR>
<LI><STRONG>Delay Costs</STRONG></LI>With these criteria&nbsp;you can improve&nbsp;the schedule according to the costs that are associated with the delayed completion of orders or activities. The following optimization criteria are available:<BR><BR>
<UL>
<LI>The sum of the delay costs</LI>
<LI>The maximum delay costs.</LI></UL></UL>
<UL>There is a delay when:<BR><BR>
<UL>
<LI>A receipt date is later than a requirement date</LI>
<LI>The latest allowable start or finish date for an activity is before the actual start or finish date.</LI><BR></UL>
<LI><STRONG>Mode costs</STRONG></LI>The mode costs for an activity are the costs that are incurred when executing an activity in a particular mode. You maintain the fixed and variable costs in the optimization profile depending on the mode priority. <BR><BR></UL>
<P>The weightings that you apply to the various times or costs in the optimization profile when defining the objective function reflect the importance of each problem for your schedule.</P>
<P>For the optimization&nbsp;a&nbsp;<STRONG>Genetic Algorithm</STRONG>, which is a stochastic meta-heuristic, is employed.&nbsp;It works by modifying the&nbsp;existing schedule of the orders&nbsp;to find a&nbsp;better result according to the objective function. It may be set to end after a certain time or if no more improvements can be found.&nbsp;Note that in both cases the final result is not necessarily the true optimum. The sequence with the best&nbsp;objective value&nbsp;can then be saved or serve as a&nbsp;starting point&nbsp;for further interactive planning.&nbsp; </P><IMG src="pages\separator_logo_e.g"> </FONT></div>
