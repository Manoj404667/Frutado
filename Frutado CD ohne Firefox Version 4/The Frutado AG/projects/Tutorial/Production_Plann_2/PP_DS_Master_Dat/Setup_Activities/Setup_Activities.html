<h1>'Setup Activities'</h1>

<P>In the Frutado AG, setup activities are required when changing the bottle type and the flavor of the beverage. These are considered to be sequence dependent. E.g., changing the flavor from a light flavor like Banana to a strong like Cherry takes less time than vice versa.</P>
<P>The <STRONG>sequence-dependent setup activities</STRONG> are represented by setup matrices. A setup matrix has to be created for each production resource. To each setup activity, a setup group or setup key is assigned to determine the required setup time and the associated costs.</P>
<P>The setup matrices indicate the possible <STRONG>setup transitions of the predecessor to the successor activity</STRONG> as well as the <STRONG>setup times</STRONG> and <STRONG>setup costs.</STRONG> While it would be possible to define all setup transitions&nbsp;using a&nbsp;<U>nXn</U> matrix (<U>n</U> being the number of products), this would require a big table which would cause stress&nbsp;to the performance of the system&nbsp; because the system has to search for the&nbsp;associated setup transition&nbsp;whenever there is an order planned.&nbsp;The fact that&nbsp;usually many products have very similar setup requirements can be exploited to&nbsp;reduce the number of entries in the table, by splitting&nbsp;the definition of setups into <STRONG>setup groups</STRONG> and <STRONG>setup keys</STRONG>. </P>
<P><STRONG>Setup groups</STRONG> can contain&nbsp;similar products, which&nbsp;have&nbsp;(mostly)&nbsp;the same setup transitions (in regard to time and costs). A so called standard setup transition&nbsp;indicates the setup transition between two setup groups. If&nbsp;exception setup transitions between certain products of the&nbsp;groups are different&nbsp;from the&nbsp;standard&nbsp;setup transition, individual exception&nbsp;setup transitions can be defined. These setup transitions are represented <STRONG>by setup keys</STRONG> which are assigned to the setup groups.</P>
<P>Remark: If setup activites are not sequence dependent, setup groups and matrices are not required.&nbsp;Then, the setup times and costs are maintained directly in the PP/DS-PPMs.</P></FONT></FONT><IMG src="pages/separator_logo_e.g"> </FONT></FONT></div>
