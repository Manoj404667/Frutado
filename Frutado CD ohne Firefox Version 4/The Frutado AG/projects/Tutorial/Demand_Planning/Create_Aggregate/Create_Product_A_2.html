This is done by the demand planner who has the possibility to create different selections on which the demand forecasts are based. In order to disaggregate the results the proportional factors calculated in the last lesson are used. The Frutado AG would like to use five different product groups, which are additionally aggregated, for all distribution centers. These groups are especially suited to minimize the observed forecast errors. Three of the aggregated groups consist of products with a steady demand while the other two consist of products with seasonal demand. In order to create the different groups it is necessary to enter the selection criteria of each group.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></div>
